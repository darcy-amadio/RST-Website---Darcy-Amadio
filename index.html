    <p1>Today you will learn how a normal race weekend in formula one works. If you don't know, Formula 1, or F1, is the highest class single seating racing seris, and each team engineers their car to be the fastest possible. The races take place internationally on different styles of tracks. Currently, there are 10 teams, and 20 drivers in F1. On a typical race weekend, this is what goes down on each day. If you want to find a certain day, scroll down to find it, as they are in chronological order.</p1>

    <h2>Thursday</h2>
    <p3>While the team has been setting up and organizing the garage for a while now, the drivers arrive on Thursday. Thrusday is a more relaxed day, as drivers take part in a press conference, and have some meetings, or debriefs, with the team to discuss how their car will be set up, and what the best strategy will be in the coming days.</p3>

    <h3>Friday</h3>
    <p6>Friday is the first day cars go on the track! Although not for any points though. There are two, 1 hour practice sessions, known as FP1, and FP2 (FP stands for free practice). During each of these sessions, teams run different programs to see the car's speed in corners and on straights, but as well as their short and long run performance. Cars can go on the track whenever they want, (hence the name, free practice.) The fastest time each driver sets is tracked during FPs, but does not count for anything. </p6>

    <h4>Saturday</h4>
    <p8>On Saturday, there is one final practice session, FP3. You dont want to crash in this one, as only a few hours later is qualifying. Qualiflying is very important in F1, becuase it is harder to overtake due to the skill of the drivers, and the tracks, as on most, there are only certain areas where it is possible to pass. There are 3 parts in the current qualifying format. Q1, Q2, and Q3. During each part of qualifying, the fastest lap time set by a car is recorded. Drivers may run as many or as few laps as they wish. After Q1 is complete, the five slowest cars are eliminated from the qualifying session. This would include any cars that did not set a qualifying time. The remaining 15 car advance to Q2, with their times reset. The five cars eliminated are placed in the last five start positions, based on their fastest time from Q1. The procedure is repeated for Q2. The five slowest cars from Q2 are placed in the 11 through 15 starting positions on the grid. The top ten cars remain for Q3. After this final part of qualifying, the top ten starting positions on the grid are set. The fastest qualifier is placed in the first position, which is known as the pole position. This car will have an advantage at the start, because they do not need to follow any other cars.</p8>

    <h5>Sunday</h5>
    <p10>Race day! It all comes down to this. The race starts by a grid start, and there are red lights that go on at the front. When they all are on, they go out after a short few secinds, and the race begins. The start is usually the most interseting, as all 20 cars are close together. As the race goes on, the fronnt runners usually spaces themselves out a bit. There is a mandatory pitstop that every driver must make in the race. One or two is all that one driver usually makes. These pit stops only last 2-3 seconds unless a mistake is made! Once the race is over, the top 3 go on the podium, and recive trophies for their respective positions. Getting a podium is a big deal, especially for weaker teams that had a great weekend. Points are awarded to drivers and teams based on their finishing order. The winner receives 25 points, the second place finisher 18 points, with 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 and 1 points for positions 3 through 10. The driver with the fastest lap of the race also gets 1 point. These points are kept track of the whole season, and whoever comes out on top, wins the championship. Teams, or constructors as commonly known as, receive points as well as drivers. Each constructor receives the same amount of points that their two drivers earned. Once the race ends, and the podium celebrations wrap up, the teams quickly pack up and leave the track.</p10>
